# Russia_World_Cup_Prediction
Python Keras model for predicting the World Champion in Russia 2018

It is built with Keras and, in my case, I'm using Tensorflow as the ML library.

So, the requirements are at least:
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Pandas
- Numpy

There is a Jupyter Notebook with the code.

Obviously, the model dosen't try to be a very accurate scientific one, but an exercise to practice, enjoy and test how machine learning algorithm can be used.

I hope you enjoy it.
